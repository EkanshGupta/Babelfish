Hubie a shy gullible but kindhearted penguin is in love with the beautiful and kind Marina but lacks selfconfidence leading him to be bullied by the much more impressive but vain and cruel Drake who also wants Marina but clearly for lust
 One night Hubie and Marina manage to confirm how they feel for each other but Hubie cannot quite find a perfect pebble to propose to Marina with
 He wishes on a star to make his dream come true and he receives an emerald from the sky
 Ecstatic Hubie rushes to find Marina but is stopped by Drake who demands Hubie to give him the pebble
 Hubie refuses so Drake throws him into the water
 Hubie narrowly escapes from a leopard seal and climbs on to a piece of ice where he is swept away from Antarctica
Hubie is picked up by humans and caged on their ship called Misery transports penguins to a zoo and meets a tough grumpy streetwise and somewhat arrogant but goodhearted rockhopper penguin named Rocko 
 After seeing in a vision Marina having a dilemma Hubie decides to escape with Rocko and flees before laying low on a beach
 Rocko reluctantly tells Hubie about his desire to fly and live in tropical climate
 He convinces him to help him return to Antarctica by making up a lie about a flying penguin named Waldo
 They have a short fight after Rocko tries to fly off an authentic ancient aviarial airstrip and another after Rocko saved Hubie from a killer whale
 Back in Antarctica Drake begins to threaten Marina for her hand in mating
 If Marina refuses she will be forced to leave as it goes against tradition
 Hubie and Rocko attempt to depart but Rocko discovers Hubie lied to him and attempts to attack Hubie but soon starts laughing praising Hubies determination to get back to Marina
 Back in Antarctica Marina becomes worried about Hubie
 Hubie and Rocko run into the hungry and persistent leopard seal but are able to escape it
 With that they become true friends 
 Their joy is short lived as killer whales attack them causing Hubies pebble to get lost in the scuffle and Rocko to go missing leaving Hubie to think he perished
Disheartened Hubie continues on alone to face Drake and defeats him in a fight
 Rocko who survives the whale attack finds Hubie and Marina at Drakes tower
 As Hubie makes a proposal to Marina and gains her acceptance Drake returns to finish the three off
 Hubie Rocko and Marina dodge the giant boulder which lethally crushes Drake in his collapsing tower
 During the escape Rockos dream for flight comes true as he flies himself Hubie and Marina to safety
 Rocko hands Hubie his pebble
 He presents it to Marina who loves it but loves Hubie more
 Rocko remains in Antartica with Hubie and Marina and sometime later he teaches their children how to fly
The Animated Movie Guide said considering the artistic and financial success of Disneys Beauty and the Beast Don Bluth and Gary Goldman decided to cater to the dating crowd in addition to preschoolers
 The Pebble and the Penguin was produced by Don Bluth Ireland Limited
 At one point production began in November 1991
 The working title of the film was A Penguin Story
 In 1994 Bluth spoke enthusiastically of such pending projects as The Pebble and the Penguin and A Troll in Central Park
 The film was originally slated for release in summer 1994  but due to some production difficulties  the films release date was changed to April 1995
Though Bluth Productions was based in Dublin artists from Ireland England and Hungary worked on the project at least seven directing animators working on the film; among them John Pomeroy
 The penguins in the film are clothed
 Humans wearing penguin costumes were filmed and then used as photostat references for the animators
 The iconic quote from Hubie Goodness glaciers as well as his overall appearance is a sly reference to Gentleman Glacier an old Canadian newspaper cartoon used to illustrate snow accumulation each year
 Only two scenes in the film were augmented by computer animation one of which being The Good Ship Misery song sequence
 The opening credit and overture sequence has the animated penguin characters playing and dancing on the sheet music for the songs in the film
 According to The Free LanceStar the animators researched for the film by watching documentaries and visiting zoos such as San Diegos Sea World and Scotlands Glasgow Zoo
 The site added that in promotional material the animators explained they discovered that the land of snow and ice shines with many different hues
Due to changes insisted by MGM animation fell behind and additional coloring had to be done at a Hungarian animation studio
 Don Bluth and Gary Goldman were so dissatisfied with the final film that they left during production  and demanded to be uncredited as the directors
 The book Animated Films said changes at MGM during production


resulted in the project being affected in terms of production value
 In a 2001 edition of his magazine Toon Talk Bluth admitted Penguin had story problems
 We knew it
 The crew knew it
 Though he attempted to fix these issues when his Irish studio got taken over by the Hong Kong company Media Assets the story and film were now compromised so neither he or Goldman stayed
 They had their names removed from the films credits and accepted an offer by Bill Mechanic  20th Century Foxs thenpresident  to set up a new animation studio in the US 
 Bluth said to his animation crew I cant chew with someone elses mouth
 Despite this executive interference The Animated Movie Guide noted MGMUA producer Walter Mirischs comments on the film I think its one of Dons best films ever


Theres no issue of our claiming the credit for this
 Its his film
The songs were written by Barry Manilow who previously wrote the songs for Thumbelina along with longtime collaborator and lyricist Bruce Sussman
 The films score was composed by Mark Watters
 Manilow who had started off wanting to be a composer got an opportunity to do this when he was approached to compose songs and the underscore for the film and Thumbelina
 Barbadian singer Geoffrey Holder sang the deleted song The Beachmaster for the film
 An accompanying soundtrack was released on April 11 1995
 The instruments in the songs and score were performed by The Irish Film Orchestra
 This soundtrack is currently out of print
This is a list of musical numbers for the filmThe films tagline was The adventure of a lifetime begins with one small pebble
 Seventyfive readers of San Antonio ExpressNews each won four tickets to the film
 The special showing was held at 11 a
m
 on April 8 at the Embassy Theaters
 The Pebble and the Penguin was crosspromoted with AnheuserBuschs Sea World Parks
The Pebble and the Penguin was accompanied in its theater run by a new Pink Panther short entitled Driving Mr
 Pink
 which was adapted from an episode of the successful Pink Panther TV series
 It is a late oneoff short in the Pink Panther short series  they were abundant and popular until 1980
 SFGate described the short as loud obnoxious  idiotic
 The short introduced the character of Voodoo Man from the 1995 TV show
 In the cartoon an animated woman runs out of a department store with only her underwear on
 It also features car chases yelling and Pink Panther getting knocked around and there is a veiled reference to an offensive gesture during the Pink Panther cartoon
The Pebble and the Penguin grossed 3983912
 It was overshadowed by A Goofy Movie which was released four days earlier
One of animator Don Bluths lesser efforts The Pebble and the Penguin is cute but little more
 The primary culprit is the script; aside from the unusual setting and small parcels of information about Emperor penguins is hackneyed and uninvolving
 The decision to focus on the relationship between Hubie and Rocko  is unfortunate as the writers bring nothing new to the buddy concept and their attempts at humorous dialogue for the pair are often painful
 With the exception of a song that pays homage to Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill the Barry ManilowBruce Sussman songs are even worse
 Bluth is incapable of creating bad animation and there are several sequences  that have moments of beauty; overall however the animation doesnt have enough sparkle to breathe life into the movie
 The cast is certainly not at fault with Martin Short doing everything short of bursting through the screen to hold the viewers attention Tim Curry turning in a reliably sinister performance and Annie Golden lending her powerful and unique belt to the little she is given to sing
 Penguin is not totally without charm  but the amount it has could almost be fit into a pebble
Rotten Tomatoes reported only 11% of critics gave positive reviews based on eight reviews with an average score of 310
 The film was given a Two Thumbs Down on Siskel & Ebert with Gene Siskel noted that the films animation looks cheap and unfinished and that none of the songs are memorable while Roger Ebert added his dislike of the dumb songs silly story and the films colorcoding of its heroes and villains
 Ebert took this a step further by arguing What do kids learn from this? Nothing overt
 Just a quiet unstated impression White is good and brave and brown is scheming and negative
 Reinforce that through lots of cartoons  and no wonder even black children choose white dolls in some psychological experiments
 Deseret News said the songs are forgettable the story onenote and the characterizations quite weak
 Reviewer Steve Rhodes said we get a stream of pointless dialog and some unfunny jokes worthy of a third rate vaudeville routine
 The Austin Chronicle said the film lacks dramatic structure and narrative drive Songs and animated action pieces are narratively connected but the film doesnt feel as though it is an organic whole
 All the elements are here they just dont come together
 TimeOut said The characterisations are weak and unendearing
 Worse the big action sequences turn up with the pacing and predictability of clock chimes
 And in what is perhaps the last great medium for musicals the perfunctoriness of Barry Manilows songs and arrangements seem guaranteed to put off yet another generation
 The New York Times wrote that 4 would be the optimum age for viewers of this gentle animated musical adding that the action seems flat and lowrent compared to those earlier movies and that it doesnt have the vivid characters firstrate animation or sense of adventure that turns movies like The Lion King into endlessly watchable favorites
 Washington Post Staff Writer Hal Hinson wrote the banality of the story the pallid look the flatness of the characters add up to a product that is at best second rate
 SFGate said the gnashing whale scenes are intense enough to push the Grating envelope
 The SpokesmanReview wrote it is only an average effort in virtually every respect
 The Record said The orchestration is too fancy too loud and often drowns out the lyrics
 This is a kids movie but musically it sounds like a fullcostume Broadway show with fullsupporting chorus line
 It added Its a little disturbing to see a childrens movie that perpetuates the erroneous image of killer whales as violent creatures
 It is however a perfect indication of the limited imagination which went into writing The Pebble and the Penguin
 The Free LanceStar said the film got a charming mating ritual and turned it into sappy action romance with celebrity voices
 The book Contemporary North American Film Directors suggested that the film suffered from the same unimaginative and cliched Disney of the 1970s that Bluth had been so critical of
 The Animated Movie Guide said the hero was a stuttering wimp the songs didnt advance the plot the dialogue was incessant and superfluous and the pacing was plodding and dull
Some critics did praise various aspects of the film however particularly in regard to Bluths animation
 These reviews however were almost exclusively mixed
 Common Sense Media said the background animation of capricious weather conditions is lovely as are the topnotch original songs by Barry Manilow and Mark Watters
 Deseret News said Bluths strength continues to be colorful classicalstyle animation and there are some gorgeous moments here  especially some underwater sequences
 The Austin Chronicle said The Pebble and the Penguin features some beautifully animated sequences  The characters are great and the voice talents of Martin Short


and James Belushi


are terrific
 Variety said the film has a heartwarming story some lively songs and professional animation adding that it is a sweet enjoyable romantic tale more likely to succeed as an afternoon diversion on homevideo than on the bigscreen
 The New York Times wrote The tunes Mr
 Manilow has written for the movie are like his familiar pop standards bouncy and catchy and commented that the animation is fine
 Washington Post Staff Writer Hal Hinson wrote that A flourishing opening numbertitled Here and Nowproves that Short can belt out a song with the best of them adding that the Bluth studio style of animation is passable and in the case of a BrechtWeill flavored production number occasionally inspired

 SFGate described the showtune style songs as pleasant but forgettable adding that the singing by Short Belushi Curry and Broadway belter Golden is the best thing about the film
 It also noted that One of the obvious obstacles was how to color a film whose natural shadings tend toward black white and degrees of gray
 The result is a lot of odd but fascinating colorations  the sky might turn up yellow at times or the sea a deep maroon
 The SpokesmanReview wrote in an era when Grated movies are as rare as Hollywood humility any attempt at family entertainment should be lauded adding let us salute Don Bluth and his team of animators
 In a rare case The Daily Gazette gave the film 4 stars
 The Animated Movie Guide said the film was an utter waste of talent and resources due to interference from external forces
 Monica Sullivan of Movie Magazine International noted that the film was heartily enjoyed by the two little girls who saw it with me at a kiddie matinee
