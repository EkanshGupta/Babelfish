Ctenophora  is a phylum of animals that live in marine waters worldwide
 Their most distinctive feature is the combs  groups of cilia which they use for swimming  they are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia
 Adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 1
5m  in size
 Like cnidarians their bodies consist of a mass of jelly with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity
 In ctenophores these layers are two cells deep while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep
 Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum Coelenterata as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration
 Increasing awareness of the differences persuaded more recent authors to classify them as separate phyla
Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain
 Genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of Ctenophora which differ in many ways from other animal neurons evolved independently from those of the other animals
Almost all ctenophores are predators taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed
 In favorable circumstances ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day
 Only 100150 species have been validated and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named
 The textbook examples are cydippids with eggshaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla  that are covered with colloblasts sticky cells that capture prey
 The phylum has a wide range of body forms including the flattened deepsea platyctenids in which the adults of most species lack combs and the coastal beroids which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large stiffened cilia that act as teeth
 These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area because they specialize in different types of prey which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use
Most species are hermaphroditesa single animal can produce both eggs and sperm meaning it can fertilize its own egg not needing a mate
 Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time
 Others are sequential hermaphrodites in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times
 Fertilization is generally external although platyctenids eggs are fertilized inside their parents bodies and kept there until they hatch
 The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow
 The exceptions are the beroids whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles and the platyctenids whose young live as cydippidlike plankton until they reach nearadult size but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form
 In at least some species juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape
 The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate
Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find
 In bays where they occur in very high numbers predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton  which are a vital part of marine food chains
 One ctenophore Mnemiopsis has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish
 The situation was aggravated by other factors such as overfishing and longterm environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population
 The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem as Beroe preys on other ctenophores
Despite their soft gelatinous bodies fossils thought to represent ctenophores apparently with no tentacles but many more combrows than modern forms have been found in lagersttten as far back as the early Cambrian about 515 million years ago
 The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated and the majority view at present based on molecular phylogenetics is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores
 A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippidlike and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently probably after the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago
 Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the cydippids are not monophyletic in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids
Ctenophores form an animal phylum that is more complex than sponges about as complex as cnidarians  and less complex than bilaterians 
 Unlike sponges both ctenophores and cnidarians have cells bound by intercell connections and carpetlike basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs
 Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts that capture prey by squirting glue on them although a few ctenophore species lack them
Like sponges and cnidarians ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jellylike material which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jellylike layer
 Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic along with sponges
 Both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that in more complex animals arises from the middle cell layer and as a result some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic while others still regard them as diploblastic
Ranging from about 1 millimeter  to 1
5 meters  in size ctenophores are the largest noncolonial animals that use cilia  as their main method of locomotion
 Most species have eight strips called comb rows that run the length of their bodies and bear comblike bands of cilia called ctenes stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat those of each comb touch the comb below
 The name ctenophora means combbearing from the Greek   meaning comb and the Greek suffix  meaning carrying
For a phylum with relatively few species ctenophores have a wide range of body plans
 Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study
 In addition oceanic species do not preserve well and are known mainly from photographs and from observers notes
 Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera  Pleurobrachia Beroe and Mnemiopsis
 At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia
Since the body of many species is almost radially symmetrical the main axis is oral to aboral 
 However since only two of the canals near the statocyst terminate in anal pores ctenophores have no mirrorsymmetry although many have rotational symmetry in other words if the animal rotates in a halfcircle it looks the same as when it started
Like those of cnidarians  ctenophores bodies consist of a relatively thick jellylike mesoglea sandwiched between two epithelia layers of cells bound by intercell connections and by a fibrous basement membrane that they secrete
 The epithelia of ctenophores have two layers of cells rather than one and some of the cells in the upper layer have several cilia per cell
The outer layer of the epidermis  consists of sensory cells; cells that secrete mucus which protects the body; and interstitial cells which can transform into other types of cell
 In specialized parts of the body the outer layer also contains colloblasts found along the surface of tentacles and used in capturing prey or cells bearing multiple large cilia for locomotion
 The inner layer of the epidermis contains a nerve net and myoepithelial cells that act as muscles
The internal cavity forms a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles; a pharynx ; a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach; and a system of internal canals
 These branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal the mouth and pharynx; the roots of the tentacles if present; all along the underside of each comb row; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth  two of these four branches terminate in anal pores
 The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium the gastrodermis
 The mouth and pharynx have both cilia and welldeveloped muscles
 In other parts of the canal system the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies
 The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles  germ cells that produce eggs or sperm and photocytes that produce bioluminescence
 The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through the canals punctuated by ciliary rosettes pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea
When prey is swallowed it is liquefied in the pharynx by enzymes and by muscular contractions of the pharynx
 The resulting slurry is wafted through the canal system by the beating of the cilia and digested by the nutritive cells
 The ciliary rosettes in the canals may help to transport nutrients to muscles in the mesoglea
 The anal pores may eject unwanted small particles but most unwanted matter is regurgitated via the mouth
Little is known about how ctenophores get rid of waste products produced by the cells
 The ciliary rosettes in the gastrodermis may help to remove wastes from the mesoglea and may also help to adjust the animals buoyancy by pumping water into or out of the mesoglea
The outer surface bears usually eight comb rows called swimmingplates which are used for swimming
 The rows are oriented to run from near the mouth  to the opposite end  and are spaced more or less evenly around the body although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth
 The combs  run across each row and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia up to 2 millimeters 
 Unlike conventional cilia and flagella which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function
 These normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth although they can also reverse direction
 Hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing unlike jellyfish
 When trying to escape predators one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed; some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia
It is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities
 Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater
 If they enter less dense brackish water the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density to avoid sinking
 Conversely if they move from brackish to fullstrength seawater the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density
Ctenophores have no brain or central nervous system but instead have a nerve net  that forms a ring round the mouth and is densest near structures such as the comb rows pharynx tentacles  and the sensory complex furthest from the mouth
The largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ 
 Its main component is a statocyst a balance sensor consisting of a statolith a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia called balancers that sense its orientation
 The statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long immobile cilia
 A ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers
 Instead its response is determined by the animals mood in other words the overall state of the nervous system
 For example if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey it will often put some comb rows into reverse spinning the mouth towards the prey
Cydippid ctenophores have bodies that are more or less rounded sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or eggshaped; the common coastal sea gooseberry Pleurobrachia sometimes has an eggshaped body with the mouth at the narrow end although some individuals are more uniformly round
 From opposite sides of the body extends a pair of long slender tentacles each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn
 Some species of cydippids have bodies that are flattened to various extents so that they are wider in the plane of the tentacles
The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla  although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches
 The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it
 Colloblasts are specialized mushroomshaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis and have three main components a domed head with vesicles  that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk
 The function of the spiral thread is uncertain but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart
 In addition to colloblasts members of the genus Haeckelia which feed mainly on jellyfish incorporate their victims stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles  some cnidariaeating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense
 The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids they contain striated muscle a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed
 Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey they may flick out very quickly ; they can wriggle which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey
 The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle
 The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles but of a highly specialized type
 Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle
There are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end and are spaced evenly round the body
 The combs beat in a metachronal rhythm rather like that of a Mexican wave
 From each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows
 This forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from the combs to the balancers via water disturbances created by the cilia
The Lobata have a pair of lobes which are muscular cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth
 Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes 
 Between the lobes on either side of the mouth many species of lobates have four auricles gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth
 This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey
Lobates have eight combrows originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body to the lobes; in species with  auricles the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb rows
 Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion although Leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion
 Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly
 Unlike cydippids the movements of lobates combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia yet combs on the same row beat in the same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids
 This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egglike
An unusual species first described in 2000 Lobatolampea tetragona has been classified as a lobate although the lobes are primitive and the body is medusalike when floating and disklike when resting on the seabed
The Beroida also known as Nuda have no feeding appendages but their large pharynx just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body bears macrocilia at the oral end
 These fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to bite off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole  almost always other ctenophores
 In front of the field of macrocilia on the mouth lips in some species of Beroe is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that zip the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip
 This tight closure streamlines the front of the animal when it is pursuing prey
The Ganeshida have a pair of small oral lobes and a pair of tentacles
 The body is circular rather than oval in crosssection and the pharynx extends over the inner surfaces of the lobes
The Thalassocalycida only discovered in 1978 and known from only one species are medusalike with bodies that are shortened in the oralaboral direction and short combrows on the surface furthest from the mouth originating from near the aboral pole
 They capture prey by movements of the bell and possibly by using two short tentacles
The Cestida  are ribbonshaped planktonic animals with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon
 There is a pair of combrows along each aboral edge and tentilla emerging from a groove all along the oral edge which stream back across most of the winglike body surface
 Cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their combrows
 There are two known species with worldwide distribution in warm and warmtemperate waters Cestum veneris  is among the largest ctenophores  up to 1
5 meters  long and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly
 Velamen parallelum which is typically less than 20 centimeters  long can move much faster in what has been described as a darting motion
Most Platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oralaboral direction with a pair of tentillabearing tentacles on the aboral surface
 They cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular foot
 All but one of the known platyctenid species lack combrows
 Platyctenids are usually cryptically colored live on rocks algae or the body surfaces of other invertebrates and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current
Adults of most species can regenerate tissues that are damaged or removed although only platyctenids reproduce by cloning splitting off from the edges of their flat bodies fragments that develop into new individuals
Almost all species are hermaphrodites in other words they function as both males and females at the same time  except that in two species of the genus Ocryopsis individuals remain of the same single sex all their lives
 The gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis
 Fertilization is external in most species but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch
 Selffertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are selffertile
Development of the fertilized eggs is direct in other words there is no distinctive larval form and juveniles of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid adults
 In the genus Beroe the juveniles like the adults lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths
 In most species the juveniles gradually develop the body forms of their parents
 In some groups such as the flat bottomdwelling platyctenids the juveniles behave more like true larvae as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the seafloor
At least in some species juvenile ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size and adults produce eggs and sperm for as long as they have sufficient food
 If they run short of food they first stop producing eggs and sperm and then shrink in size
 When the food supply improves they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction
 These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly
Most ctenophores that live near the surface are mostly colorless and almost transparent
 However some deeperliving species are strongly pigmented for example the species known as Tortugas red  which has not yet been formally described
 Platyctenids generally live attached to other seabottom organisms and often have similar colors to these host organisms
 The gut of the deepsea genus Bathocyroe is red which hides the bioluminescence of copepods it has swallowed
The comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect which is not caused by bioluminescence but by the scattering of light as the combs move
 Most species are also bioluminescent but the light is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness
 However some significant groups including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia are incapable of bioluminescence
When some species including Bathyctena chuni Euplokamis stationis and Eurhamphaea vexilligera are disturbed they produce secretions  that luminesce at much the same wavelengths as their bodies
 Juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies
 Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals environments such as depth or whether they live in coastal or midocean waters
In ctenophores bioluminescence is caused by the activation of calciumactivated proteins named photoproteins in cells called photocytes which are often confined to the meridional canals that underlie the eight comb rows
 In the genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode photoproteins
 These genes are coexpressed with opsin genes in the developing photocytes of Mnemiopsis leidyi raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals
Ctenophores are found in most marine environments from polar waters to the tropics; near coasts and in midocean; from the surface waters to the ocean depths
 The bestunderstood are the genera Pleurobrachia Beroe and Mnemiopsis as these planktonic coastal forms are among the most likely to be collected near shore
 No ctenophores have been found in fresh water
Almost all ctenophores are predators  there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic
 If food is plentiful they can eat 10 times their own weight per day
 While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores other surfacewater species prey on zooplankton  ranging in size from the microscopic including mollusc and fish larvae to small adult crustaceans such as copepods amphipods and even krill
 Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their preys nematocysts  into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts
 Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey  some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as webs some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread as bolas spiders do
 This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species
 The twotentacled cydippid Lampea feeds exclusively on salps close relatives of seasquirts that form large chainlike floating colonies and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow
 Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey Pleurobrachias long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae
Ctenophores used to be regarded as dead ends in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals
 It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue
 Detailed investigation of chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around
 Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores
 Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations
 Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population most fish that prey on them are generalists and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jellyeaters
 The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood
Ctenophores may balance marine ecosystems by preventing an overabundance of copepods from eating all the phytoplankton  which are the dominant marine producers of organic matter from nonorganic ingredients
On the other hand in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish
 Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories  as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities
 The impact was increased by chronic overfishing and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a shortterm boost causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal  and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores
 Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsiseating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993 which significantly slowed the animals metabolism
 However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to preMnemiopsis levels
In the late 1990s Mnemiopsis appeared in the Caspian Sea
 Beroe ovata arrived shortly after and is expected to reduce but not eliminate the impact of Mnemiopsis there
 Mnemiopsis also reached the eastern Mediterranean in the late 1990s and now appears to be thriving in the North Sea and Baltic Sea
The number of known living ctenophore species is uncertain since many of those named and formally described have turned out to be identical to species known under other scientific names
 Claudia Mills estimates that there about 100 to 150 valid species that are not duplicates and that at least another 25 mostly deepsea forms have been recognized as distinct but not yet analyzed in enough detail to support a formal description and naming
The traditional classification divides ctenophores into two classes those with tentacles  and those without 
 The Nuda contains only one order  and family  and two genera Beroe  and Neis 
The Tentaculata are divided into the following eight ordersBecause of their soft gelatinous bodies ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagersttten places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue
 Until the mid1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known both members of the crown group from the early Devonian  period
 Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age about 505 million years ago in the midCambrian period
 All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows far more than the 8 typical of living species
 They also appear to have had internal organlike structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores
 One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular
 Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian but perhaps very different from modern species  for example one fossils combrows were mounted on prominent vanes
 The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly
The early Cambrian sessile frondlike fossil Stromatoveris from Chinas Chengjiang lagersttte and dated to about 515 million years ago is very similar to Vendobionta of the preceding Ediacaran period
 DeGan Shu Simon Conway Morris et al
 found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia used for filter feeding
 They suggested that Stromatoveris was an evolutionary aunt of ctenophores and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system
520 million years old Cambrian fossils from Chengjiang in China were armored comb jellies with hard spiny skeletons and no tentacles
The relationship of ctenophores to the rest of Metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity
 It has been the focus of debate for many years
 Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria sister to the Cnidaria sister to Cnidaria Placozoa and Bilateria and sister to all other animal phyla
 A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways  showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla
 A more recent study comparing the sequenced genome of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi with other sequenced animal genomes showed multiple lines of evidence supporting ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals
 This position suggests that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages  or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage
 Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes
Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippidlike larvae it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids having an eggshaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles
 Richard Harbisons purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid
 Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids
 He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippidlike or beroidlike
 A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001 using 26 species including 4 recently discovered ones confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippidlike
 It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small  so small that the relationships between the Lobata Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain
 This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event 65
5 million years ago while other lineages perished
 When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain
