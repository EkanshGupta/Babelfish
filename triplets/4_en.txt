Gravel rvl is composed of unconsolidated rock fragments that have a general particle size range and include size classes from granule to bouldersized fragments
 Gravel is categorized by the UddenWentworth scale into granular gravel  and pebble gravel 
 One cubic yard of gravel typically weighs about 3000 pounds 
Gravel is an important commercial product with a number of applications
 Many roadways are surfaced with gravel especially in rural areas where there is little traffic
 Globally far more roads are surfaced with gravel than with concrete or tarmac; Russia alone has over 400000km  of gravel roads
 Both sand and small gravel are also important for the manufacture of concrete
Large gravel deposits are a common geological feature being formed as a result of the weathering and erosion of rocks
 The action of rivers and waves tends to pile up gravel in large accumulations
 This can sometimes result in gravel becoming compacted and concreted into the sedimentary rock called conglomerate
 Where natural gravel deposits are insufficient for human purposes gravel is often produced by quarrying and crushing hardwearing rocks such as sandstone limestone or basalt
 Quarries where gravel is extracted are known as gravel pits
 Southern England possesses particularly large concentrations of them due to the widespread deposition of gravel in the region during the Ice Ages
As of 2006 the United States is the worlds leading producer and consumer of gravel
The word gravel comes from the Breton language
 In Breton grav means coast
 Adding the el suffix in Breton denotes the component parts of something larger
 Thus gravel means the small stones which make up such a beach on the coast
 Many dictionaries ignore the Breton language citing Old French gravele or gravelle
Gravel often has the meaning a mixture of different size pieces of stone mixed with sand and possibly some clay
 American English also allows small stones without sand mixed in also known as crushed stone
Multiple types of gravel have been recognised includingIn locales where gravelly soil is predominant plant life is generally more sparse
 This outcome derives from the inferior ability of gravels to retain moisture as well as the corresponding paucity of mineral nutrients since finer soils that contain such minerals are present in smaller amounts
