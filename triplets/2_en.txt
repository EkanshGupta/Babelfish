Foxtail millet  is the secondmost widely planted species of millet and the most important in East Asia
 It has the longest history of cultivation among the millets having been grown in China since sometime in the sixth millennium BC
 Other names for the species include dwarf Setaria foxtail bristle grass giant setaria green foxtail Italian millet German millet Chinese millet and Hungarian millet
Foxtail millet is an annual grass with slim vertical leafy stems which can reach a height of 120200cm 
The seedhead is a dense hairy panicle 530cm  long
The small seeds around 2mm  in diameter are encased in a thin papery hull which is easily removed in threshing
 Seed color varies greatly between varieties
Seeds of foxtail milletMochiAwa Japanese foxtail milletNames for foxtail millet in other languages spoken in the countries where it is cultivated includeIn South India it has been a staple diet among people for a long time from the sangam period
 It is popularly quoted in the old Tamil texts and is commonly associated with Lord Muruga and his consort Valli
In China foxtail millet is the most common millet and one of the main food crops especially among the poor in the dry northern part of that country
 In Europe and North America it is planted at a moderate scale for hay and silage and to a more limited extent for birdseed
It is a warm season crop typically planted in late spring
 Harvest for hay or silage can be made in 6570 days  and for grain in 7590 days 
 Its early maturity and efficient use of available water make it suitable for raising in dry areas
Diseases of foxtail millet include leaf and head blast disease caused by Magnaporthe grisea smut disease caused by Ustilago crameri and green ear caused by Sclerospora graminicola
 The unharvested crop is also susceptible to attack by birds and rodents
The wild antecedent of foxtail millet has been securely identified as Setaria viridis which is interfertile with foxtail millet; wild or weedy forms of foxtail millet also exist
 Zohary and Hopf note that the primary difference between the wild and cultivated forms is their seed dispersal biology
 Wild and weedy forms shatter their seed while the cultivars retain them
 The earliest evidence of the cultivation of this grain comes from the Peiligang culture of China which also cultivated the common millet but foxtail millet became the predominant grain only with the Yangshao culture
Foxtail millet arrived in Europe later; carbonized seeds first appear in the second millennium BC in central Europe
 The earliest definite evidence for its cultivation in the Near East is at the Iron Age levels at Tille Hoyuk in Turkey with an uncorrected radiocarbon date of about 600 BC
